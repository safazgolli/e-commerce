# e-commerce

## Description:

 A back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, SO that any company can compete with other e-commerce companies.

* A functional Express.js API

- If I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize.
- If I enter schema and seed commands, a development database is created and is seeded with test data.
- If I enter the command to invoke the application, my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.
- If I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
- If I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.

## Demo:
In order to use this project, make requests to the API endpoints with an application such as Insomnia:
